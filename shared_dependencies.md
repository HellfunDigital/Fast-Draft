1. "index.html": This file will contain the main structure of the application. Shared dependencies include DOM element IDs such as "textEditor", "generateButton", "outputDisplay" that will be used by JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This file will contain the styling for the application. It will use the same IDs and class names defined in the "index.html" file such as "textEditor", "generateButton", "outputDisplay".

3. "main.js": This file will contain the main logic of the application. It will use the DOM element IDs from "index.html" and functions from "openai_api.js" and "document_generator.js". Shared function names might include "init", "generateText", "displayOutput".

4. "openai_api.js": This file will contain the functions to interact with the OpenAI API. It will export functions like "callOpenAI", which will be used in "main.js". It might also use a shared data schema for the API request and response.

5. "document_generator.js": This file will contain the logic to generate novel length documents. It will export functions like "generateDocument", which will be used in "main.js". It might also use a shared data schema for the document structure.

Shared data schemas might include "apiRequest", "apiResponse", "documentStructure". These schemas define the structure of data that is sent to and received from the OpenAI API, and the structure of the generated document respectively.

Shared message names might include "generationComplete", "error". These messages are used to communicate the status of the document generation process between different parts of the application.
